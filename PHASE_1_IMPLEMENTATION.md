## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Application Loading | 200-500ms | 50-100ms | **60-80% faster** |
| Search Operations | 20-50ms | 5-15ms | **60-75% faster** |
| LocalStorage Writes | 10-30ms | 2-5ms | **70-85% faster** |
| Initial Load Time | 350-500ms | <100ms | **70-80% faster** |
| Storage Operations | 1 per state change | <1 per second | **80%+ reduction** |

## üõ† Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Example usage throughout the codebase
performanceMonitor.measureAsync('app-refresh', async () => {
  const freshApps = await asyncApplicationLoader.loadApplications(true);
  setApplications(freshApps);
});
```

### Batched Storage
```typescript
// Before: Immediate writes
LocalStorage.setItem("usageTimes", JSON.stringify(usageTimes));

// After: Batched writes
storageManager.set("usageTimes", usageTimes); // Batches automatically
```

### Async Application Loading
```typescript
// Before: Synchronous blocking operations
const files = readdirSync(directory);

// After: Async non-blocking operations  
const files = await fs.promises.readdir(directory);
```
